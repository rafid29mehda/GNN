### Recent Insights and Limitations in Graph Signal Processing (GSP) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for Biological Data

#### 1. **Overview of GSP and GNN Applications in Biology**
   - **Current Uses**: Graph Signal Processing (GSP) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are increasingly used in modeling biological systems, including neural and molecular networks, patient data, and disease progression. These techniques allow researchers to analyze data structured in non-Euclidean spaces, making them highly suitable for biological applications【17†source】【18†source】.
   - **Applications in Precision Medicine**: GSP and GNNs are applied in personalized medicine to model patient-specific data, predict disease progression, and explore gene-disease associations. Additionally, GNNs aid in drug discovery by predicting interactions between drugs and their molecular targets【18†source】【19†source】.

#### 2. **Challenges and Areas for Improvement**
   - **Scalability Issues**: A primary limitation is computational scalability, especially in processing high-dimensional, large-scale biological networks. High costs associated with spectral decomposition, such as graph Laplacian eigenvalue calculations, make it challenging to scale up GSP methods for large datasets. Techniques like Chebyshev polynomials and graph attention mechanisms have been proposed to reduce this complexity but may still be limited in extremely large networks【18†source】【20†source】.
   - **Interpretability of GNNs**: One challenge in GNN applications is the interpretability of learned features and results. While models such as Graph Attention Networks (GAT) attempt to add interpretability, understanding specific biological implications within complex network data remains challenging. Researchers are exploring hybrid methods combining GSP and interpretable machine learning to address this【19†source】【20†source】.
   - **Network Topology Inference**: Often, the exact network topology for biological data isn’t known, which impacts the accuracy of GNN-based models. There’s a pressing need for effective methods to infer biologically meaningful topologies. This has led to development in graph topology inference techniques, yet it is still an area needing further exploration and optimization【17†source】.

#### 3. **Underexplored Applications and Future Directions**
   - **Gene-Disease and Protein-Protein Interaction Networks**: There is potential to apply GNNs to model complex interactions between genes and proteins, particularly in identifying rare disease biomarkers or predicting drug response. Such studies could provide significant advancements in genomics and pharmacology by uncovering hidden relationships in biological networks【19†source】.
   - **Multi-Omics Data Integration**: Combining genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, and epigenomics data through graph-based frameworks remains underexplored. Integrating multi-omics data could facilitate a comprehensive view of cellular and molecular processes, thus improving disease prediction models【18†source】.
   - **Neuroscience Applications**: While GNNs are used in brain imaging and functional connectivity studies, there is room to improve models for tasks such as brain region segmentation and understanding neurological disorders. GSP techniques, like graph-based filters, are also being developed to enhance signal decoding in fMRI and EEG data, potentially offering improved insights into brain structure and function【20†source】.

By targeting these gaps, researchers can make significant contributions to this field. Future advancements will likely involve developing more efficient, interpretable GNN models, enhancing scalability, and exploring multi-omics and personalized medicine applications.
