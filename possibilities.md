2. **Predicting Adverse Drug Events**: Using subgraph-level predictions, GNNs are utilized to foresee adverse drug events, proving effective for drug safety and monitoring applications ([ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010482524013672)).

3. **Enhanced Load Balancing in Cloud Networks**: Combining GNN and logistic regression, this approach optimizes cloud security by efficiently balancing load and classifying malicious requests, pivotal for IoT and cloud systems ([Springer](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10586-024-04754-3)).

4. **Spiking Graph Neural Networks**: By applying spiking GNNs on Riemannian manifolds, researchers aim to improve energy efficiency and real-time processing, promising for neuromorphic computing applications ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17941)).

5. **Industrial Process Monitoring with DAMPNN**: A novel dynamic adaptive message-passing neural network adapts to the changing conditions in industrial soft sensors, enhancing robustness in data monitoring ([IEEE Transactions](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10734590/)).
