Let's dive into the data structure and preprocessing steps for both MRI and ECG datasets used in the Heart-Net model in a simple, beginner-friendly way.

### MRI Data Structure and Preprocessing

#### 1. **Understanding MRI Data Structure**
   - **What is MRI Data?** MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) scans capture detailed images of the inside of the body. For heart scans, MRI provides a 3D view of the heart, showing different structures like the left and right ventricles.
   - **3D Structure**: Think of each MRI scan as a stack of images (or "slices") of the heart, from the top to the bottom. When put together, these slices form a 3D image, like a loaf of sliced bread showing the whole structure in layers.
   - **Data Format**: In Heart-Net, each MRI scan is saved as a 3D matrix (a grid of numbers) with a shape like `(1, 32, 32, 32)`, meaning:
     - `1`: Number of channels (1 for grayscale images).
     - `32, 32, 32`: Dimensions (height, width, depth) of each 3D image.

#### 2. **MRI Data Preprocessing Steps**
   - **Goal**: Make sure all MRI data has a consistent format, so the model can "read" it effectively.
   
   - **Step 1: Resizing**
     - MRI scans can come in different sizes, just like how photos can have different dimensions.
     - We need to resize each MRI scan to a standard size, for example, `(32, 32, 32)`.
     - **Example**: If you have a scan with dimensions `(40, 40, 40)`, you can "resize" it to fit `(32, 32, 32)` by cropping or scaling it down.

   - **Step 2: Normalization**
     - MRI images can have different brightness levels, which are measured in "pixel values" (like the shades of gray in a black-and-white photo).
     - To make all scans look similar in brightness, we normalize these values between 0 and 1.
     - **How?** Divide each pixel value by the maximum pixel value in the image.
     - **Example**: If the maximum value in an MRI scan is `255`, divide each pixel by `255`, so values are between `0` and `1`.

   - **Step 3: Data Augmentation**
     - Just like flipping or rotating a picture to see it from different angles, we do the same with MRI scans.
     - We can rotate, flip, or zoom into MRI images to create "new" images, which helps the model learn more features.
     - **Example**: Rotate an MRI by 90 degrees or flip it horizontally to create a variation of the same image.

#### **MRI Data Preprocessing Code Example**

```python
import numpy as np
import torch
from skimage.transform import resize

# Simulate loading a raw MRI scan (random data here for illustration)
mri_scan = np.random.randint(0, 255, size=(40, 40, 40))  # Original size

# Resize to (32, 32, 32)
mri_resized = resize(mri_scan, (32, 32, 32), mode='constant')

# Normalize pixel values to be between 0 and 1
mri_normalized = mri_resized / np.max(mri_resized)

# Convert to tensor and add channel dimension
mri_tensor = torch.tensor(mri_normalized, dtype=torch.float32).unsqueeze(0)  # Shape (1, 32, 32, 32)
```

### ECG Data Structure and Preprocessing

#### 1. **Understanding ECG Data Structure**
   - **What is ECG Data?** An ECG (Electrocardiogram) records the heart's electrical activity over time, like a graph that shows each heartbeat.
   - **1D Structure**: Unlike MRI (which is 3D), ECG data is 1D (one-dimensional), like a line that goes up and down with each heartbeat.
   - **Data Format**: In Heart-Net, each ECG is a sequence (line) of numbers representing the electrical activity at different time points. It might look like an array with values such as `[0.1, 0.3, -0.2, 0.0, 0.5, ...]`, and a typical length could be 256 data points.

#### 2. **ECG Data Preprocessing Steps**
   - **Goal**: Make ECG data uniform in length and reduce noise.

   - **Step 1: Filtering (Noise Removal)**
     - Just like how a radio can have static, ECG data can have "noise" or unwanted signals.
     - **Bandpass Filter**: We can use a bandpass filter to only keep the frequency range relevant for heartbeats.
     - **Example**: If the useful frequency range for ECG is 0.5 to 40 Hz, we can filter out anything outside this range to get a cleaner signal.

   - **Step 2: Segmentation**
     - ECG signals can be very long, sometimes hours of data, which is hard for the model to handle all at once.
     - We divide the ECG data into shorter, fixed-length segments (like cutting a long rope into smaller pieces).
     - **Example**: Take segments of 256 points each from a longer ECG signal.

   - **Step 3: Normalization**
     - Like MRI, ECG values can vary widely. We normalize them to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
     - **How?** Subtract the mean and divide by the standard deviation.
     - **Example**: If the mean of an ECG segment is `0.5` and the standard deviation is `0.2`, each value in the segment will be `(value - 0.5) / 0.2`.

#### **ECG Data Preprocessing Code Example**

```python
import numpy as np
import torch
from scipy.signal import butter, filtfilt

# Simulate loading raw ECG data (random values for illustration)
ecg_signal = np.random.randn(1024)  # Assume 1024 data points in the original signal

# Bandpass filter function
def bandpass_filter(signal, lowcut=0.5, highcut=40.0, fs=1000.0, order=5):
    nyquist = 0.5 * fs
    low = lowcut / nyquist
    high = highcut / nyquist
    b, a = butter(order, [low, high], btype='band')
    return filtfilt(b, a, signal)

# Apply bandpass filter
ecg_filtered = bandpass_filter(ecg_signal)

# Segment into smaller parts (e.g., 256 points per segment)
segment_length = 256
ecg_segment = ecg_filtered[:segment_length]  # Take the first 256 points for example

# Normalize the segment to mean 0 and std 1
ecg_normalized = (ecg_segment - np.mean(ecg_segment)) / np.std(ecg_segment)

# Convert to tensor
ecg_tensor = torch.tensor(ecg_normalized, dtype=torch.float32).unsqueeze(0)  # Shape (1, 256)
```

### Summary

- **MRI Data**: We work with 3D images (like a cube) representing heart structures. Preprocessing involves resizing to `(32, 32, 32)`, normalizing pixel values, and augmenting with rotations.
- **ECG Data**: This is a 1D line graph representing heartbeats over time. Preprocessing includes filtering to remove noise, segmenting into shorter sections (e.g., 256 points), and normalizing to make the values consistent.

Using these steps, you can get MRI and ECG data in a standard format, ready to be used by the Heart-Net model for heart disease diagnosis.
