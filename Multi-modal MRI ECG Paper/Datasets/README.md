Let's break down the **data formats** required for Heart-Net and potential sources where you can find similar datasets that can be preprocessed to fit this model. Heart-Net uses two primary types of data: **3D MRI data** (for spatial features) and **1D ECG data** (for temporal features).

### 1. **MRI Dataset Requirements**
   - **Format**: MRI images in Heart-Net are in a 3D format, representing cardiac structures over several slices or "volumes" to capture depth.
   - **Expected Shape**: For each MRI scan, you’ll typically want a 3D matrix with a shape such as `(1, 32, 32, 32)`, where:
      - The first dimension is the number of channels (usually 1 for grayscale MRI images).
      - The next three dimensions represent the depth, height, and width of the 3D image.
   - **Labels**: Each MRI scan should ideally be labeled with the patient’s heart disease status (e.g., healthy or specific types of heart disease).

   #### Example Dataset Sources
   - **Sunnybrook Cardiac Data** ([Link](https://www.cardiacatlas.org/sunnybrook-cardiac-data/)): Contains cine-MRI images focused on cardiac regions. These images can be preprocessed to fit the required 3D format.
   - **UK Biobank** ([Link](https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk)): Has comprehensive heart MRI datasets. Access requires an application, but it contains various labeled cardiac conditions.
   - **Automated Cardiac Diagnosis Challenge (ACDC)** ([Link](https://www.creatis.insa-lyon.fr/Challenge/acdc/databases.html)): Provides 3D MRI data, labeled with different heart conditions, specifically for analyzing the left and right ventricles.

   #### Preprocessing Steps
   - **Normalization**: Scale pixel intensities between 0 and 1.
   - **Resizing**: Resize or crop all MRI images to the same shape (e.g., 32x32x32) to ensure uniform input dimensions for the model.
   - **Data Augmentation**: Rotate or flip the images to increase dataset variability, improving model generalization.

### 2. **ECG Dataset Requirements**
   - **Format**: The ECG data in Heart-Net is treated as sequential data, represented as a 1D signal over time. It is often segmented into cycles or windows to extract temporal patterns.
   - **Expected Shape**: Each ECG sequence could be represented as a vector of length `T`, where `T` is the number of time steps. In the model, it’s typical to reshape these sequences into graph structures where nodes represent time segments.
   - **Labels**: Each ECG sequence should be labeled with a diagnostic label similar to MRI data.

   #### Example Dataset Sources
   - **MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database** on PhysioNet ([Link](https://physionet.org/content/mitdb/1.0.0/)): One of the most popular ECG datasets with labeled arrhythmia data. It contains multiple leads and annotations for each beat type.
   - **PTB Diagnostic ECG Database** ([Link](https://physionet.org/content/ptbdb/1.0.0/)): A large ECG dataset that includes multiple heart disease diagnoses.
   - **Kaggle ECG Heartbeat Dataset** ([Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shayanfazeli/heartbeat)): Contains segmented ECG signals labeled as normal or various types of arrhythmia, which can be preprocessed to fit this model.

   #### Preprocessing Steps
   - **Filtering**: Apply bandpass filters to remove noise and focus on relevant frequencies.
   - **Segmentation**: Segment the ECG into cycles or windows (e.g., 256 time steps per window) to standardize the length.
   - **Normalization**: Standardize each ECG sequence to zero mean and unit variance for consistency across signals.
   - **Graph Representation**: Convert each segment into a graph structure, with nodes representing key points (such as peaks) in the ECG cycle and edges representing temporal dependencies.

### 3. **Creating the Datasets for Heart-Net**

Here’s a breakdown of how to prepare and format these datasets:

#### Example for **MRI Data Formatting**
If you download data from the Sunnybrook or ACDC datasets, you can format it as follows:

```python
# Load your 3D MRI data (example assumes it's already in a numpy array format)
import numpy as np
import torch

# Assume 'mri_scan' is a single MRI scan loaded as a 3D numpy array
# Preprocess: Resize and normalize to (1, 32, 32, 32) for a grayscale scan

mri_scan = np.random.rand(32, 32, 32)  # Replace with actual loaded data
mri_scan = mri_scan / np.max(mri_scan)  # Normalize between 0 and 1
mri_tensor = torch.tensor(mri_scan, dtype=torch.float32).unsqueeze(0)  # Shape (1, 32, 32, 32)
```

#### Example for **ECG Data Formatting**
If you use the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database or PTB Database, you can format it as follows:

```python
# Load your ECG data (example assumes it's already in a numpy array format)
# Example of a single ECG sequence (1D array of length T)

ecg_sequence = np.random.rand(256)  # Replace with actual loaded ECG data
ecg_sequence = (ecg_sequence - np.mean(ecg_sequence)) / np.std(ecg_sequence)  # Normalize to zero mean, unit variance
ecg_tensor = torch.tensor(ecg_sequence, dtype=torch.float32).unsqueeze(0)  # Shape (1, 256)
```

### Where to Access and Preprocess for Use in Heart-Net

1. **For MRI Data**:
   - Download from **Sunnybrook Cardiac Data** or **ACDC**.
   - Resize all images to a standard 3D shape, normalize, and store in `.npy` or tensor format for efficient loading.

2. **For ECG Data**:
   - Download from **MIT-BIH** or **PTB Diagnostic ECG Database**.
   - Segment ECGs into uniform windows (e.g., 256 samples per window), filter noise, normalize, and store as 1D numpy arrays or tensors.

These steps will prepare MRI and ECG data to be compatible with the Heart-Net architecture. With preprocessed MRI and ECG data in standardized shapes, you can proceed to train the Heart-Net model using the outlined steps for a multi-modal deep learning approach.
