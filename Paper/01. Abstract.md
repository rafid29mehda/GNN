### Simplified Abstract for Heart-Net

Heart disease is one of the top causes of illness and death worldwide, creating a strong need for better ways to diagnose it. Traditional diagnostic methods often rely on just one type of data (like MRI or ECG alone) and can be affected by issues with the equipment or image quality. This limits their accuracy, especially in places where resources and expertise are limited.

New technologies like **artificial intelligence (AI)** and **machine learning (ML)** offer ways to improve diagnosis by combining multiple types of data, leading to better patient care and lower healthcare costs. This study introduces **Heart-Net**, an advanced deep learning model that combines **Cardiac MRI** (3D images of the heart) and **ECG** (electrical signals of the heart) for a more accurate heart disease diagnosis.

Heart-Net uses:
- **3D U-Net** to analyze MRI data, capturing detailed heart structure,
- **Temporal Convolutional Graph Neural Network (TCGN)** for extracting patterns in ECG data.

These features are combined through an **attention mechanism** that highlights the most important parts of the data. Finally, Heart-Net uses an optimized classification model to make the diagnosis.

Testing showed that Heart-Net performs better than traditional methods:
- **92.56% accuracy** on Dataset I (HNET-DSI),
- **93.45% accuracy** on Dataset II (HNET-DSII),
- **91.89% accuracy** on Dataset III (HNET-DSIII).

Heart-Netâ€™s multi-modal approach also reduces the impact of equipment issues and low-quality images, showing its potential to transform heart disease diagnosis and improve patient care.
