### Simplified Explanation of Preprocessing and Data Balancing

In Heart-Net, preprocessing is crucial for preparing both MRI images and ECG data so they’re ready for accurate diagnosis of heart disease. Here’s how each type of data is prepared step-by-step, followed by a technique called **ADASYN** for balancing the data when some classes (types of heart conditions) have fewer examples.

### 1. Preprocessing MRI Images

To make sure MRI images are consistent and suitable for training, the following steps are applied:

1. **Normalization**:  
   - Each pixel in the MRI image is converted to a value between 0 and 1. This makes the brightness consistent across all images, so the model isn’t affected by differences in brightness.
   - **Formula**: For each pixel, the formula is:
     \[
     I_{i,j} = \frac{I_{i,j} - \text{min}(I)}{\text{max}(I) - \text{min}(I)}
     \]
     where \( I_{i,j} \) is the pixel value, and min(I) and max(I) are the smallest and largest values in the image. This keeps all values within the range [0, 1].

2. **Resizing**:  
   - All images are resized or cropped to the same size (e.g., **256x256 pixels**). This makes sure that each MRI image has the same dimensions, which is necessary for feeding the images into the model.

3. **Data Augmentation**:  
   - This step creates slightly different versions of each image by rotating, flipping, or zooming. It helps the model learn to recognize heart features from various angles and improves its ability to generalize.
   - **Example**: If an original MRI image shows the heart from one angle, augmented images could show slight rotations or mirror images, giving the model more diverse data to learn from.

### 2. Preprocessing ECG Data

ECG data, which are numerical sequences showing the heart’s electrical activity over time, need different preprocessing steps:

1. **Normalization**:  
   - For each feature (or column) in the ECG data, we make the mean (average) equal to 0 and the spread of data (variance) equal to 1. This helps ensure that all features are on the same scale.
   - **Formula**:
     \[
     x' = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}
     \]
     where \( x \) is a feature value, \( \mu \) is the mean of that feature, and \( \sigma \) is the standard deviation. This process centers the data, making it easier for the model to learn patterns.

2. **One-Hot Encoding for Labels**:  
   - If we have labels (like heart condition types), each label is converted into a unique binary vector. For example, if there are three classes, they might be represented as:
     - Class 1: [1, 0, 0]
     - Class 2: [0, 1, 0]
     - Class 3: [0, 0, 1]

### 3. Balancing the Data with ADASYN

In medical datasets, some classes (types of heart conditions) may have fewer examples than others. For instance, there may be fewer cases of a rare heart condition compared to common ones. This imbalance can make it hard for the model to learn equally about all classes. To solve this, **Adaptive Synthetic Sampling (ADASYN)** is used to create more data for the less common classes.

Here’s how ADASYN works:

1. **Identify the Imbalance**:  
   - Calculate the ratio between the majority class (most common condition) and the minority class (less common condition).
   - **Formula**:
     \[
     r = \frac{N_{\text{majority}}}{N_{\text{minority}}}
     \]
     where \( N_{\text{majority}} \) is the number of samples in the common class, and \( N_{\text{minority}} \) is the number in the rare class.

2. **Find Similar Data Points**:
   - For each example in the minority class, ADASYN finds its **k-nearest neighbors** in the data. This means it looks for similar samples in the majority class to learn from their structure.

3. **Create Synthetic Samples**:
   - ADASYN generates new examples for the minority class by taking a minority class sample and slightly altering it based on its neighbors. This is done by adding a small random value to make the new samples look like natural variations.
   - **Formula**:
     \[
     x_{\text{new}} = x_i + \delta \times (x_{i,\text{nn}} - x_i)
     \]
     where \( x_i \) is a sample from the minority class, \( x_{i,\text{nn}} \) is one of its neighbors, and \( \delta \) is a small random number between 0 and 1.

4. **Combine with Original Data**:
   - The newly created synthetic samples are added to the original dataset, making the classes more balanced.

### Summary of Preprocessing and Balancing

1. **MRI Images**:
   - Normalize pixel values to [0,1].
   - Resize to a standard shape.
   - Apply data augmentation to create more diverse examples.

2. **ECG Data**:
   - Normalize each feature to have a mean of 0 and variance of 1.
   - Use one-hot encoding for class labels to make them machine-readable.

3. **ADASYN (for Balancing)**:
   - Identify minority classes.
   - Create synthetic examples for underrepresented classes by adjusting minority samples based on nearby examples.
   - Add these synthetic samples to the original data, making it balanced and ready for training.

Through these steps, Heart-Net ensures that the MRI and ECG data are standardized, diverse, and balanced, setting a strong foundation for training an accurate and reliable model for heart disease diagnosis.
