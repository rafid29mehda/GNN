Here’s a simplified summary of the **Data Collection** section:

### Overview of Datasets Used

The researchers used three important datasets, referred to as **HNET-DSI**, **HNET-DSII**, and **HNET-DSIII**, to evaluate Heart-Net. Each dataset provides different types of data for analyzing heart conditions.

#### 1. **HNET-DSI**: Sunnybrook Cardiac Data (SCD)
   - **Purpose**: Used for analyzing the left ventricle in cardiac MRI images.
   - **Description**: Contains 450 MRI images (cine-MRI format) showing different patients and heart conditions.
   - **Source**: Known as the **2009 Cardiac MR Left Ventricle Segmentation Challenge** data.
   - **Access Link**: [Sunnybrook Cardiac Data](https://www.cardiacatlas.org/sunnybrook-cardiac-data/) (Accessed on 2 March 2024).

#### 2. **HNET-DSII**: ECG Dataset from MIT-BIH PhysioNet
   - **Purpose**: Provides ECG records for diagnosing four types of heart ailments.
   - **Description**: Contains 1200 ECG records in total, with 300 records for each of the four heart conditions.
      - ECG records were segmented into smaller samples, creating 4120 samples per condition.
      - Signals were normalized and preprocessed with bandpass filters to improve quality.
      - **Feature Extraction**: A technique called MODWPT (Multiscale Discrete Wavelet Packet Transform) extracted 54 features from each ECG record, which are stored in a CSV file with dimensions of 1200 rows by 54 columns.
   - **Access Link**: [ECG Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akki2703/ecg-of-cardiac-ailmentsdataset) (Accessed on 4 March 2024).

#### 3. **HNET-DSIII**: Hybrid Dataset from the UK Biobank
   - **Purpose**: Offers a combination of MRI and ECG data for more comprehensive analysis.
   - **Description**: Contains data from 1300 subjects in total, including paired MRI images and ECG readings.
      - Among these, 1150 subjects are considered healthy, while 150 have cardiovascular issues.
      - MRI images have a voxel resolution of 1.8 x 1.8 x 8.0 mm³.
   - **Access Link**: Available on GitHub (no specific link provided in the text).

### Summary Table (Table 2)

Each dataset contributes uniquely to Heart-Net’s evaluation:
   - **HNET-DSI** provides cine-MRI images for structural analysis.
   - **HNET-DSII** offers ECG records for functional analysis, each record containing 54 extracted features.
   - **HNET-DSIII** includes both MRI and ECG data for 1300 subjects, allowing for a combined analysis of structure and function.

These datasets enable Heart-Net to learn from multiple data types, improving its diagnostic accuracy for different heart conditions.
