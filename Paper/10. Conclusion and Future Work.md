### Simplified Explanation of the Conclusion and Future Work for Heart-Net

#### Conclusion

Traditional methods for diagnosing heart disease rely on either MRI images or ECG data alone, which has limitations:
- **Single-modality dependence**: Using just one type of data can miss important information about heart health.
- **Apparatus faults**: Diagnostic equipment like ECG machines or MRI scanners can sometimes produce errors or low-quality images, leading to missed or incorrect diagnoses.

Computer-based models, like those using machine learning, often depend heavily on image data (like MRI and X-rays) for diagnosis. However, these methods can struggle if the images are blurry or low quality, which affects their accuracy.

In this study, **Heart-Net** was introduced as a solution. Heart-Net is a **multi-modal deep learning framework** designed to improve heart disease diagnosis by combining:
- **3D MRI data** (analyzing heart structure in 3D).
- **ECG data** (capturing electrical activity of the heart over time).

Using a **3D U-Net** for MRI images and a **Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (GTCN)** for ECG data, Heart-Net combines both types of information, offering a more complete view of heart health. This approach makes the diagnosis more accurate and thorough. In tests, Heart-Net achieved high accuracy rates:
- 92.56% for the HNET-DSI dataset,
- 93.45% for the HNET-DSII dataset,
- 91.89% for the HNET-DSIII dataset.

#### Future Work

To make Heart-Net even more powerful and adaptable, future improvements will include:
1. **Incorporating More Data Types**: Adding additional data sources, like blood test results or ultrasound data, to improve diagnostic accuracy.
2. **Enhancing Model Features**:
   - **Refining the Attention Mechanism**: Adjusting the attention mechanism will help the model better focus on the most important parts of the data.
   - **Improving Classification Algorithms**: Tweaking the algorithms used to classify heart disease will boost Heart-Netâ€™s performance.
3. **Expanding the Dataset**: Including more diverse samples to ensure that Heart-Net is robust and reliable across different populations and heart conditions.
4. **Real-Time Data from Wearable Devices**: By adding real-time data from wearable devices (like heart rate monitors), Heart-Net could provide continuous health monitoring, making it a valuable tool for proactive heart care.

In summary, Heart-Net represents an advanced approach for heart disease diagnosis, with promising results and a roadmap for future improvements that will make it even more adaptable, accurate, and useful in real-world clinical settings.
