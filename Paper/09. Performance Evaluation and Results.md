### Performance Evaluation Measures

Heart-Net uses several key measures to evaluate its effectiveness in diagnosing heart disease:

1. **Precision**:
   - Measures the accuracy of the positive predictions (correct heart disease predictions).
   - **Formula**: 
     \[
     \text{Precision} = \frac{\text{TP}}{\text{TP} + \text{FP}}
     \]
   - **Example**: If the model predicted heart disease 10 times, and 8 of those predictions were correct, the precision would be 80%.

2. **Recall**:
   - Measures the ability to correctly identify all actual positive cases.
   - **Formula**:
     \[
     \text{Recall} = \frac{\text{TP}}{\text{TP} + \text{FN}}
     \]
   - **Example**: If there were 20 cases of heart disease, and the model correctly identified 18, the recall would be 90%.

3. **F1 Score**:
   - Balances precision and recall into a single measure.
   - **Formula**:
     \[
     \text{F1 Score} = 2 \times \frac{\text{Precision} \times \text{Recall}}{\text{Precision} + \text{Recall}}
     \]
   - **Example**: If both precision and recall are 90%, the F1 score will also be 90%.

4. **Accuracy**:
   - Overall, accuracy tells us the percentage of correct predictions out of all predictions made.
   - **Formula**:
     \[
     \text{Accuracy} = \frac{\text{TP} + \text{TN}}{\text{TP} + \text{TN} + \text{FP} + \text{FN}}
     \]
   - **Example**: If there were 100 predictions, and 90 were correct, the accuracy would be 90%.

5. **ROC Curve and AUC**:
   - The **Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC)** curve shows the model’s ability to distinguish between positive and negative cases.
   - **Area Under Curve (AUC)**: A score close to 1 means the model performs well in distinguishing between heart disease and healthy cases.

### Baseline Methods

To evaluate the performance of Heart-Net, four baseline methods were used as comparisons:

1. **Baseline 1**:
   - Proposed by Sohaib et al., using CNN and LSTM to classify heart disease.
   
2. **Baseline 2**:
   - Introduced by Ogunpola et al., who used different machine learning algorithms to improve heart disease prediction accuracy.

3. **Baseline 3**:
   - Proposed by Raviprakash et al., using SVM and Random Forests for identifying heart abnormalities.
   
4. **Baseline 4**:
   - Presented by Islam et al., using Recursive Feature Extraction (RFE) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for heart disease prediction.

Each baseline offers a different approach for comparison, helping to assess Heart-Net’s performance relative to other established methods.

### Results and Model Performance

1. **K-Fold Cross Validation**:
   - Heart-Net was tested using **5-fold cross-validation**, which splits the data into five parts and trains the model five times, each time using four parts for training and one for testing. This method ensures reliable results by averaging the performance across all five rounds.

2. **Performance Across Datasets**:
   - Heart-Net was tested on three datasets, showing high performance on each one:
     - **HNET-DSI**: Accuracy: 91.74%, Precision: 90.15%, Recall: 91.45%
     - **HNET-DSII**: Accuracy: 93.47%, Precision: 91.2%, Recall: 92.24%
     - **HNET-DSIII**: Accuracy: 92.25%, Precision: 91.45%, Recall: 92.05%

3. **Confusion Matrix**:
   - A confusion matrix for each dataset (HNET-DSI, HNET-DSII, HNET-DSIII) showed the actual vs. predicted classifications, indicating how well the model distinguished between heart disease and healthy cases.

4. **ROC Curves**:
   - ROC curves showed an **AUC of 0.93** across datasets, meaning the model is good at distinguishing between true heart disease cases and healthy cases with a high true positive rate and a low false positive rate.

5. **Comparison with Islam et al.’s Method**:
   - Heart-Net outperformed Islam et al.'s method across all three datasets:
     - **HNET-DSI**: Heart-Net accuracy was 92.56%, 1.31% higher than Islam et al.’s method.
     - **HNET-DSII**: Heart-Net achieved 93.45%, an improvement of 1.47%.
     - **HNET-DSIII**: Heart-Net had 91.89% accuracy, 2.87% higher than Islam et al.’s method.

### Summary of Heart-Net’s Superiority

Heart-Net’s advanced feature extraction methods and classification techniques led to superior performance:
- It achieved high accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores across all datasets.
- The model showed significant improvements over the baseline methods and Islam et al.’s approach, making Heart-Net an effective tool for heart disease prediction and diagnosis.

In short, Heart-Net demonstrated impressive diagnostic abilities by combining multiple data types (MRI and ECG) and utilizing state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to outperform other methods. This makes it a promising tool for more accurate and early heart disease diagnosis.
