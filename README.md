The document "Graph Signal Processing, Graph Neural Network and Graph Learning on Biological Data: A Systematic Review" systematically explores how graph-based methods such as Graph Signal Processing (GSP), Graph Neural Networks (GNN), and graph learning are applied to biological data. Below is a detailed breakdown of each section in the paper, covering major concepts and applications:

### 1. **Introduction**
   This section introduces the evolution and increasing data volume in biological research, focusing on omics and physiological monitoring data. These datasets enable insights into complex biological networks, but they pose challenges due to their size and complexity. The section emphasizes the role of graphs in modeling biological interactions across different levels, such as molecules or entire populations. Additionally, GSP and GNN are highlighted as valuable methods for processing and understanding these intricate datasets, especially for analyzing brain networks, protein-protein interactions, and gene-disease associations.

### 2. **Methodology Outline and Categorization**
   Here, the authors outline the different approaches within GSP and GNN, along with their applications in decoding biological signals and interpreting network relationships. They categorize these methods as:
   - **GSP Techniques:** Emphasizing signal processing on graphs, including graph filters and Fourier transforms.
   - **GNN Applications:** Using nodes, edges, or entire graphs for tasks like predicting diseases or drug interactions.
   - **Graph Learning:** Inferring network structures when underlying biological connections are unknown.

### 3. **Graph Signal Processing (GSP)**
   This section covers foundational GSP techniques and their adaptation for biological data analysis, including:
   - **Graph Fourier Transform (GFT):** Analogous to Fourier Transform for time series, GFT allows decomposition of graph data to reveal patterns.
   - **Graph Filters:** Techniques to smooth or extract signal features, useful in applications like brain activity analysis.
   - **Vertex-Frequency Representations:** Allowing localized graph analysis similar to time-frequency analysis, useful for EEG and fMRI studies.
   - **Applications of GSP in Biology:** Applications are largely centered on neuroscience, such as decoding fMRI data with brain connectivity graphs, feature extraction in biomedical engineering, and identifying neurological disorder patterns.

### 4. **Graph Neural Networks (GNN)**
   GNNs are explored for their capability to handle relational biological data, particularly with deep learning techniques. The paper discusses:
   - **GNN Variants:** From Spectral GNNs to Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and Graph Attention Networks (GATs), highlighting their different filtering and aggregation methods.
   - **Applications in Biological Research:** Node-wise learning for molecular classification, edge-wise learning for interaction prediction (e.g., gene-disease associations), and graph-wise learning for population-level studies in fields like neurology and cancer research.

### 5. **Graph Topology Inference**
   The paper explores how graph topology is often inferred in biological research, especially where true network structures are unknown. Inferred networks are used for GSP and GNN analyses, significantly impacting outcomes in studies like brain network connectivity and cellular interaction networks.

### 6. **Future Directions**
   The final section discusses open challenges and future research directions, including:
   - Improving computational efficiency for large-scale biological graphs.
   - Enhancing the interpretability of graph-based models in complex biological systems.
   - Expanding graph-based analysis into other fields of biological research beyond current applications.

This paper provides a comprehensive view of the latest applications of GSP, GNN, and graph learning within biological research, offering a roadmap for developing more advanced techniques to handle the growing complexity of biological data.
